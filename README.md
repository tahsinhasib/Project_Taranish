Project Description Example:

Taranish is a program designed to implement a virtual marketplace that facilitates 
the buying of games available for users on its platform. It has been designed with 
ease of usage, design and practicality in mind. 

●	User Features : 
------------------
Satisfaction of user is Taranish’s first priority. The program was designed for the users to navigate easily by providing different features such as displaying the list of games as well as purchasing games. Users can create new accounts on their own and use the accounts to access the main functionalities of the program including seeing the available games, adding games to cart and searching for games. There is also a virtual payment gateway included which is triggered after user checks out. There is also no limitation regarding the number of users.

●	Admin Features :
------------------
The admin can monitor the entire program and make necessary changes if necessary. For example, the admin can search for the games which are available and can insert and delete games according to their will depending on the circumstances. There is also no limitation regarding the number of games added. Games which are inserted are stored permanently and therefore the closure of the program has no effect on the database of games. Admin has more power over the program and determines which and what type of games are available.
